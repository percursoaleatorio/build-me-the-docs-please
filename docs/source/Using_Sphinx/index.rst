Using the technical documentation generator
*******************************************

Introduction
============

The purpose of this section is
to provide 'quick' reference information
(on syntax, available tools, style conventions, etc)
that may be required by technical writers or translators
working with the project documentation.

The most important information is about reStructuredText_,
the markup language used in the technical documentation
(user manual, etc.).

There is also some (basic) information about Sphinx_,
the application that automatically converts the text files
and generates the documentation in HTML format or PDF format.

For example, this HTML page was originally written in reStructuredText.
Please, press the *Source* link in the menu to see the original text and markup.
